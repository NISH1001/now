Now. Present. Alive. I guess...

### Hi, I am Nish

#### Where Am I?
Currently, I am living somewhere on the surface of a *pale blue dot*; a land called **Nepal**.  
I am living in Kathmandu, Nepal where I have lived more than half of my life (and still ticking).

#### What Are You Working On?
I am working as a **Data Scientist** in a small (yet exciting) [Barclays Acceleratred](https://home.barclays/who-we-are/innovation/barclays-accelerator/companies/docsumo/) startup [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/). 

(*Only few know of this little galaxy which is revolving around solving the important problem of extracting information and knowledge from documents. Note the word *"Scientist"* which is an overstatement for me as I know so little about everything in the universe!*)

However, right now I am a leading research (and experiments) on Machine Learning.  
Currently, I am doing research on Graph Neural Networks and Table Structure Recognitions.


#### Anything Interesting You've Started?

I have deleted all the social media account in order to focus more on my learning and thinking processes.

I have started my personal newsletter [bits-and-paradoxes](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/).  
(Do subscribe if you want. :)  )

It was one of few ideas I couldn't implement  partly because I lack (still I guess) self-confidence. And partly because I feel I know nothing about the world around.

(*Currently it's in 18th week*)

Anyway, I am trying to re-structuring knowledge base using [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/).  
It's kinda messy. Yet is able to make myself comfortable.

:)


#### What's You Daily Routine?
With lockdown in place here in Kathmandu I have solidified a few habits:

- I go to bed around 9 pm and wake up around 5 am (with tolerance of 30 minutes).
- I do around 30-45 minutes of *calisthenics*.
- I "try" to read, learn and analyze the world more.
- Remote working.


#### What's In Your Mind-Cave?
Initially during the COVID-19 crisis, I was still seeking grad schools in USA. All of them rejected me. So that's that.
Anyway, I am planning to look into them (probably Canada) next year once this COVID-19 situations calm down.
