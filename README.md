# Hi, I am Nish

# Where Am I?
Curently, I am in the states pursuing my graduate study at University of Alabama in Huntsville. I arrived here on Spring 22. 
I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at UAH  with the [NASA-IMPACT](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact) lab, mainly focused on research aspect.

# What Are You Working On?

## Currently, GRA at UAH.

Currently I am a CS Graduate Research Assistant (RA) at University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) with the [NASA-IMPACT](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact) lab. 

My primary focus is on Machine Learning research for Earth Sceince at NASA. I have primarily worked on 2 things so far:

- I Worked on large-scale data (Petabytes) transfer solutions from ESA-to-NASA.
    - I worked on building an open source data transfer evaluation framework which helped us evalaute different tools (pros/cons) for the transfer.

- As a part of NASA’s Bio-physical Science (BPS) collaboration, I worked on machine learning-based gene ranking
algorithms for gene expression data from space-flown rodents and presented my poster for AGU 22. I built an ensemble-based ranking framework that helps identify *important* genes that contribute to the different physical attributes (*gender*, *age*, *condition*, etc.) of the rodents.
    - (Pending collaborative paper).
    - I am currently extending this work for my MS thesis where I am working on NN-based feature attribution algorithms.
    - [Final Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cEjAjpJ0TlrlrJBfD1c83iotnwveuyqVoTteYrMOcaM/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [AGU 22 Poster](https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=09-EF-D1-4E-79-96-DD-AB-AD-F0-C9-30-74-E0-63-4F)

- Currently, I am involved in Large Language Model (LLMs) research to use LLMs for downstream Earth-Science tasks.

## Previously, Senior Data/Research Scientist at Docsumo


Docsumo is a Document-AI company.

 Previously, I was working as a Senior **ML Engineer + Research/Data Scientist** in a **Document AI** startup [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/), solving the important problem of extracting information and knowledge from documents. 

> I (helped) built most of the initial infrastructure for end-to-end Machine Learning Engineering, including training and inference pipelines. Eg: Table Extraction
Framework, Graph-based key-value extraction frameworks, etc.

I led, supervised, and implemented Machine Learning research and ML engineering for Document AI. This allowed me to do in-depth research on applied ML and work on the engineering side of building end-to-end scalable ML systems.

- Developed end-to-end training and inference pipelines within the Docsumo ecosystem. (This enabled anyone to use ML models to predict key-values and tables)
- Developed a robust table extraction pipeline that drastically increased the ”automatic extraction” of tables from documents. (This helped Docsumo to add TableML to the Docsumo ecosystem)
- Built several (extensible) internal tools to efficiently transfer/evaluate data within the Docsumo ecosystem.
- Built a table extraction engine/framework for extracting tables as per rules or ML models. This is in fact used in several production clients such as NDR

Implemented different NLP + Computer-Vision-based algorithms to assess any document’s quality
- Built document fraud detection framework using images and texts
- Developed layout-based + graph-based models for key-value extraction

# Anything more?

Oh, I am on Twitter now at [@nishparadox](https://twitter.com/nishparadox). I tweet mostly about:
- machine learning, et al
- my eternal existential crises
- tech in general
- mental models

BTW, I mostly put my thoughts in my perosnal knowlege base using [logseq](https://logseq.com/) which is open-source!
It's kinda messy. Yet is able to make myself comfortable.

## Anyway,

### bits-and-paradoxes newsletter

Oh, btw! I had started my personal newsletter [bits-and-paradoxes](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/).
However, it's on a long hiatus. It was one of few ideas I couldn't implement  partly because I lack (still I guess) self-confidence. And partly because I feel I know nothing about the world around.


:)

### the-void podcast
Also, me and Bikram had started a new podcast series [the-void](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_In8LSy3oWOoOQO-SPTFzA).


### What's Your Daily Routine?
- wake up
- feel dreaded (and gratitude) about my existence
- try to ponder (and feel more dreaded) about ML research+engineering happening around
- browse HN, Twitter, LessWrong, Reddit
- mostly, stare into the abyss
- work on my thesis
- poetry, music, musings, et al is also something that keep me sane enough


#### What's In Your Mind-Cave?


> Life is a suffering-optimization algorithm!
