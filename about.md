### Hi, I am Nish

#### Where Am I?
Currently, I am living somewhere on the surface a *pale blue dot*; a land called **Nepal**.  
I am living in Kathmandu, Nepal where I have lived more than half of my life (and still ticking).

#### What Are You Working On?
I am working as a **Data Scientist** in a small (yet exciting) [Barclays Acceleratred](https://home.barclays/who-we-are/innovation/barclays-accelerator/companies/docsumo/) startup [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/). 
Only few know of this little universe which is doing an impactful works on extracting information and knowledge from documents.

Note the word *"Scientist"* which is an overstatement for me as I know so little about everything in the universe!

However, right now I have my mind (and body) on **Computer Vision** and **NLP**, especially algorithms and Machine Learning.

Also, I am also working (on and off) on my side two projects:
- [playx](https://github.com/NISH1001/playx) - a music assistant
- [panim](https://github.com/NISH1001/panim) - a personal math animation tool

As a background, I tend to have an "engineering" Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** and that you shouldn't judge me solely based on my "educational" background. There are a lot of things that are hidden in plain sights... :)

Right now, I am trying to go for grad schools in USA. I have been rejected by 3 universitties (top 100) so far. Let's see.

#### What's You Daily Routine?
- I tend to go to bed around 9 pm and wake up around 5 am (with tolerance of 30 minutes).
- I do around 30-45 minutes of *calisthenics*
- I "try" to read long articles

##### Anyway
I don't know what I want do in my life, but surely I get fascinated by the whole nature of reality and the universe that I tend to have more 
affinity towards algorithms and problem-solving.  


My mind-cave is hidden somewhere [here](https://nish1001.github.io/mind-cave/).  
I also have my bits scattered in my newsletter [here](bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/).

Nevertheless, I am trying to find meanings in all these absurdities I think I am holding on.
