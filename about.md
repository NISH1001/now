Now. Present. Alive. I guess...

# Hi, I am Nish

You can call me whatever you like though. I am a paraodx!

# Where Am I?

I finished my MS CS from UAH in July 2023.

Currently I am working as a "Computer Scientist" at [NASA-IMPACT](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact).

# What Are You Working On?

## Computer Scienitst 


I am at the intersection of Machine Learning research + engineering with NASA-funded projects. That means, I get to dive deep into the research problem, generate new ideas,
apply existing ones too, come up with solutions (or perhaps more problems to solve) that help advance the field of Earth Science.
My general tendency is to encourage more **open science** no matter what and this aligns with NASA-IMPACT.

## Okay, what are you really working on?

Well, heard of ChatGPT? Bard? Gemini? Claude? LLama? *<put all the Large Language Models (LLMs) out in the market here>*.
I am working with LLMs to leverage their capabilities to build hybrid search systmes for NASA projects.
I lead a team called *Augmented Search* which focuses just on that. RAG, LLM agents, text-to-sql, you name it. I am working on these.

## Previously GRA at UAH

As a GRA, I workedd on a very applied research for my master's thesis: *Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Space with Applications to Gene Expression Data*.
As a part of NASAâ€™s Bio-physical Science (BPS) collaboration, I worked on machine learning-based gene ranking
algorithms for gene expression data from space-flown rodents and presented [my poster for AGU 22](https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=09-EF-D1-4E-79-96-DD-AB-AD-F0-C9-30-74-E0-63-4F). I built an ensemble-based ranking framework that helps identify *important* genes that contribute to the different physical attributes (*gender*, *age*, *condition*, etc.) of the rodents.

> Beyond that, everything is a past now which helped shape my mental models and capabilities as an empathetic human being.

# Anything more?

I am Nish. I don't do much, except staring at the abyss as long as I can.

BTW, I mostly put my thoughts in my perosnal knowlege base using [logseq](https://logseq.com/) which is open-source!
It's kinda messy. Yet is able to make myself comfortable.

## Anyway,

### bits-and-paradoxes newsletter

This newsletter feels like an ancient past I wish I could touch,  but failed. Anyway, here it is: [bits-and-paradoxes](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/).


### What's Your Daily Routine?
- wake up
- feel dreaded (and gratitude) about my existence
- try to ponder (and feel more dreaded) about ML research+engineering happening around
- less opinions, more exploration about the world
- minimizing my HN/Reddit/LessWrong consumption
- poetry, music, musings, et al 
- staring into the abyss


#### What's In Your Mind-Cave?


> Life is a suffering-optimization algorithm!
