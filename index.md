### Hi, I am Nish

#### Where Am I?
Curently, I am in the states pursuing my graduate study at UAH. I arrived here on Spring 22. (Still getting used to with the cultural shock.)

#### What Are You Working On?

Currently I am a CS Graduate Research Assistant (RA) at University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). I am doing MS in CS.

> Previously, I was working as a **Research/Data Scientist** in a small (yet exciting) [Barclays Acceleratred](https://home.barclays/who-we-are/innovation/barclays-accelerator/companies/docsumo/) startup [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/). Only few know of this little galaxy which is revolving around solving the important problem of extracting information and knowledge from documents. Note the word *"Scientist"* which is an overstatement for me as I know so little about everything in the universe!). However, right now I am a leading research (and experiments) on Machine Learning.  


#### Anything Interesting You've Started?

It's been more than 2.5 years I have deleted all the social media account in order to focus more on my learning and thinking processes; to reinforce a lot of my personal knowledge and values.

I had started my personal newsletter [bits-and-paradoxes](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/). However, it's on a long hiatus. It was one of few ideas I couldn't implement  partly because I lack (still I guess) self-confidence. And partly because I feel I know nothing about the world around.

Oh, btw, I use [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) as my knowledge base. It's kinda messy. Yet is able to make myself comfortable.

:)

Also, me and Bikram had started a new podcast series [the-void](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_In8LSy3oWOoOQO-SPTFzA).


#### What's Your Daily Routine?
TBA


#### What's In Your Mind-Cave?
It'll take some time to adjust to the new culture here in the states. Grad school is challenging. I know I can work hard. I am up for that.
