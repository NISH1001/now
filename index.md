# Hi, I am Nish

You can call me whatever you like though. I am a paradox!

# Where Am I?

Currently, I am working as a "Computer Scientist" at [NASA-IMPACT](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact).

# What Are You Working On?

## Computer Scientist at NASA IMPACT

I am at the intersection of Machine Learning research and engineering with NASA-funded projects, particularly focusing on Earth Science. My role involves delving into research problems, generating new ideas, and applying existing ones to solve challenges that advance our understanding of Earth systems.

I'm a strong advocate for **open science**, and this aligns well with NASA-IMPACT’s mission to push boundaries in Earth Science through machine learning.

### Tools 

Some works include building tools like:
- **[Larch](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/larch)**: A composable and extensible framework for search, allowing for flexible search architectures and ranking algorithms.
- **[evalem](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/evalem)**: An evaluation framework for machine learning pipelines, focused on assessing model performance and reliability.
- **[Data Transfer Evaluation Framework](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/data-transfer-evaluation)**: A benchmarking framework to evaluate large-scale data transfers between the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA.


## Okay, what are you really working on?

I am currently working in **Natural Language Processing/Understanding(NLP/NLU)**, especially with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, leveraging their capabilities to empower machine learning workflows for various NASA projects. My current work involves -- research + engineering -- LLM training, fine-tuning, active learning, and implementing guardrails to ensure reliable model outputs. Additionally, the work also involve low-resource ML solutions where we're dealing with low amount of data and smaller language models.

## Previously: GRA at UAH

As a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA), I focused on applied research for my master's thesis, *Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Space with Applications to Gene Expression Data*. I collaborated with NASA’s Bio-Physical Science (BPS) team to develop machine learning-based gene ranking algorithms for space-flown rodents' gene expression data.

I presented [my poster at AGU 22](https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=09-EF-D1-4E-79-96-DD-AB-AD-F0-C9-30-74-E0-63-4F), which highlighted my ensemble-based ranking framework to identify significant genes contributing to physical attributes such as gender, age, and condition of the rodents.

> Beyond that, everything is in the past now, shaping my current work and philosophy as a researcher and a human being.

# Workshops+Presentation++

Additionally, I also love to actively engage in workshops and presentations to share insights on machine learning and LLMs, and to foster innovation in the Earth Science and AI community.

- **NASA SMD AI Workshop (March 25-27, 2024)**: Volunteered and gave a talk/presentation on **Evaluating LLMs** in the context of Earth Science applications. This workshop brought together experts from various domains to explore the role of AI and ML in advancing NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) goals. [Workshop details and speaker page](https://nasa-impact.github.io/nasa-smd-ai-workshop-2024/speakers/nishan-pantha/).

- **SRM University Hackathon & Workshop (April 2024, India)**: Conducted a workshop and organized a hackathon focused on leveraging machine learning workflows for **remote sensing** applications. This event aimed to encourage students to apply ML techniques to real-world challenges in Earth Science. [LinkedIn post about the event](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7190711428427702273/).

These experiences reflect my passion for knowledge-sharing and fostering a collaborative environment for innovation in AI and Open Science.


# Anything more?

I am Nish. I don’t do much, except stare into the abyss and try to make sense of this paradox we call existence.

BTW, I mostly document my thoughts in my personal knowledge base using [logseq](https://logseq.com/), which is open-source! It's a bit chaotic, but it helps me stay grounded.

**Vipassana Retreat**: Oh I also went for a 10-day Vipassana retreat at Idaho Falls in mid-July 2024. Whenver I am asked the question *"how was it?"*, I reply, "It was **transformative**". :)
I try to meditate whenever I am free of other works.

## Anyway,

### bits-and-paradoxes newsletter

I once started a newsletter that feels like a piece of the ancient past. Here it is: [bits-and-paradoxes](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/).

### What's Your Daily Routine?

- Wake up
- Meditate (Vipassana/Anapana)
- Feel gratitude and invoke **mettā**
- Ponder (and feel dread) about ML research + engineering that's hard to keep up each day
- Explore the world with curiosity over opinions
- Minimize consumption of HN/Reddit/LessWrong and noisy-internet in general.
- Enjoy poetry, music, musings, et al
- Stare into the abyss, equanimously (at least trying)

#### What's In Your Mind-Cave?

> Life is a suffering-optimization algorithm!
